My professional goal is to become a developer, with a particular passion for innovative technologies and creating interactive tools.<br><br>Outside of IT, sports play an important role in my life. I played basketball for 9 years and had the opportunity to share my passion as a coach for 2 years. After a sports injury, I had to stop playing basketball, but I found another way to stay active by focusing on physical training. This practice helps me maintain a balance between my physical and mental well-being while pursuing my professional goals."
